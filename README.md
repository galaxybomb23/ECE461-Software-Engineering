## Description

### ACME Module Evaluator CLI
This repository contains a command-line tool designed to help ACME Corporationâ€™s service engineering teams evaluate and select reliable open-source Node.js modules. The tool analyzes each module based on key metrics such as ramp-up time, correctness, bus factor, maintainer responsiveness, and license compatibility. Results are output in NDJSON format with detailed scores and latencies for each metric.

## Install

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxybomb23/ECE461-Software-Engineering
```

## Usage
All usage for this project is through the `run` executable.

### NOTE for WSL users:
You may encounter the following error when trying to run the checker/run script
```bash
bad interpreter: /bin/bash^M: no such file or directory
```
This is because windows saves the file using CRLF format while WSL expects it to be a LF format. To fix this you need to change the line ending for the file to LF. This can be done in VScode or using `dos2unix` and running the following command:
```bash
dos2unix run test.sh test/URLS.txt checker/one-url.txt 
```

### Initial Setup
`cd` into the cloned directory. 

Create a new file titled `.env` in the root of the repo. Copy and paste the text below into the file. Paste your GitHub API token in the quotes after `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Type the desired log level into the quotes after `LOG_LEVEL`. Paste the path of your log file in the quotes after `LOG_FILE`.

Log levels include:
|Debug|Level| 
|--|--|
|0|Error|
|1|Info|
|2|Debug|

```
GITHUB_TOKEN = "<github_token>"
LOG_LEVEL = "info"
LOG_FILE = "logs/run.log"
```

Run the following command in a terminal while in the root of the repo to install the dependencies:
```bash
./run install
```

### Building
To build the project  run the following command:
```bash
./run build
```

### Cleaning
To clean the project  run the following command:
```bash
./run clean
```

### Test Bench
To run the test bench run the following command:
```bash
./run test
```

### Run with text file of URLs
To run the project with a text file of URLs run the following command:
```bash
./run <path/to/file>
```
and replace the `<path/to/file>` with the path of the text file you are trying to process. Make sure that the text file contains **1 URL per line**.
